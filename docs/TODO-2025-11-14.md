Ideas / Backlog
- Address autocomplete: optional inline “Address set” chip/toast on selection (and a small map preview under the field).
- Address UX follow-ups:
  - Add a Clear Address action that resets street + City/State/Zip.
  - Normalize US state to 2-letter uppercase on save; format ZIP as 5 or ZIP+4.
  - Add Address Line 2 to Contacts and auto-fill subpremise when present (mirrors Properties).
  - Pre-seed the picker on edit with the stored address text to improve visual continuity.
  - Add a debug flag (e.g., window.PLACES_DEBUG) to log the place object when selections are made.
- EmailLog table for granular email events (type, recipients, subject) beyond estimate-level counts
- Per-user preferences: last active contact tab, Comms filter defaults, Kanban visibility defaults
- Duplicate estimate items into a new estimate; optional multi-select import between estimates
- Spinners on Save & Append/Replace to avoid double submit; toasts standardized across pages
